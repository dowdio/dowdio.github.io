The most difficult part is sitting.  Sitting and observing thought.  Letting the mind go and observing your breath in one simple posture.  I'm not real when I'm in Zazen.  I am floating.  I hear sounds but I don't react.  Sometimes my mind reacts but I always bring it back to the breath.  It never escapes for to long.  Sometimes I catch myself planning or reminiscing.  Sometimes I'm tired.  


That happened to me today.  I had the greatest of plans for this week.  I mean like get up early and conquer the world kind of stuff.  The reality was I didn't get out of bed until 9 and I was exhausted by 11.  I stared at my wife for a full 5 minutes until she kindly got up and made me coffee.  The plans didn't happen and that's just fine.  I must feel like if I don;t make big plans nothing will happen.  I can and will do nothing.  Not even Zen nothing.  Absolutely nothing..  Then maybe I'll go for a run.  I look at running like a reset button.  Too much stress, go for a run.  Instant cure.    


I never have imaginerary conversations.  That is something I don;t do much anymore. Not sure if thats getting older or practing zen.         


I've been practing Zazen for a few months and it has transformed the way I see time.  My days have become weeks and my life more routine.  
**Cast off body and mind

Notes from Wiki:
According to Master Shengyen,

"While you are practicing just sitting, be clear about everything going on in your mind. Whatever you feel, be aware of it, but never abandon the awareness of your whole body sitting there. Shikantaza is not sitting with nothing to do; it is a very demanding practice, requiring diligence as well as alertness. If your practice goes well, you will experience the 'dropping off' of sensations and thoughts. You need to stay with it and begin to take the whole environment as your body. Whatever enters the door of your senses becomes one totality, extending from your body to the whole environment. This is silent illumination."

"To study the Way is to study the Self. To study the Self is to forget the self. To forget the self is to be enlightened by all things of the universe. To be enlightened by all things of the universe is to cast off the body and mind of the self as well as those of others"

-Dogen Zenji
