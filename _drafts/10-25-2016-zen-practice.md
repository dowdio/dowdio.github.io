The most difficult part is sitting.  Sitting and observing thought.  Letting the mind go and observing your breath in one simple posture.  I'm not real when I'm in Zazen.  I am floating.  I hear sounds but I don't react.  Sometimes my mind reacts but I always bring it back to the breath.  It never escapes for to long.  Sometimes I catch myself planning or reminiscing.  Sometimes I'm tired.  


That happened to me today.  I had the greatest of plans for this week.  I mean like get up early and conquer the world kind of stuff.  The reality was I didn't get out of bed until 9 and I was exhausted by 11.  I stared at my wife for a full 5 minutes until she kindly got up and made me coffee.  The plans didn't happen and that's just fine.  I must feel like if I don;t make big plans nothing will happen.  I can and will do nothing.  Not even Zen nothing.  Absolutely nothing..  Then maybe I'll go for a run.  I look at running like a reset button.  Too much stress, go for a run.  Instant cure.    


I never have imaginerary conversations.  That is something I don;t do much anymore. Not sure if thats getting older or practing zen.         


I've been practing Zazen for a few months and it has transformed the way I see time.  My days have become weeks and my life more routine.
