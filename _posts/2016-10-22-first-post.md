Software development is the application of psychology to computer science with the very real constraint of economics.  It's a never ending journey paved with budgets and code but the people are my favorite part.  They're all unique but with the same underlying emotions.  I can say after 10+ years that I don't enjoy crowds much anymore. 

I do love making things work.  I like to think I make peoples lives easier.  That's really my goal at the end of the day.  Build something that improves someone else's life. Even if it is just some html and little bit of javascript.
