Software development is the application of psychology to computer science with the very real constraint of economics.  It's budgets, code, and people all the way down.

The people are my favorite part.  We're all unique but with the same underlying emotions.  I can honestly say after 10+ years that I don't enjoy crowds much anymore. 

I do love making things work.  I like to think I make peoples lives easier.  That's really my goal at the end of the day.  Build something that improves someone else's life. Even if it is just some html and little bit of javascript.
